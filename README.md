To play the game, roll the dice by clicking the "Roll" button. You can hold specific dice by clicking on them, which will prevent them from being rolled again. You have up to three rolls per turn to create specific combinations and score points. The scores will be automatically updated as the game progresses.

If you want to restart the game, click the "Restart Game" button at the top of the page. This will reset the scores and dice rolls, allowing you to start a new game.
